### 1. **Information We Collect**

APODiary does **not** collect any personally identifiable information. The app functions purely as a viewer for publicly available data from NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API, and does not require account creation or submission of any personal data.

---

### 2. **Third-Party Services**

While APODiary integrates content via NASAâ€™s APOD API, we do **not** share or transmit any user data to NASA or any other third parties, as no personal information is collected to begin with.

---

### 3. **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**

The app does **not** use cookies or similar tracking technologies. Your interactions remain private and local to your device.

---

### 4. **Security**

Since APODiary does not collect or store personal information, there is no sensitive data that requires encryption or additional security measures. However, we ensure all API communications follow secure best practices.

### 5. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If there are any significant changes, you will be notified within the app. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed.
